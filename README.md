**TASK DESCRITION** :  For this task, I developed a classic **Snake Game** using the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)** in C++. The game features a snake that the player controls using the arrow keys, with the objective of eating food that randomly appears on the screen, causing the snake to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself, and the player's score increases each time the snake eats food. The project was implemented using SFML for graphics rendering, window management, and user input handling, along with basic C++ for game logic. The game window is set to **800x600 pixels**, and the snake and food are represented by **20x20 pixel squares**, with the snake colored green and the food colored red. The snake's movement is grid-based, and the player can control its direction using the arrow keys, with restrictions to prevent the snake from reversing direction (e.g., it cannot go left while moving right). Food is randomly generated on the screen, ensuring it does not overlap with the snake's body, and the game includes collision detection for both walls and the snake's body. When the snake eats food, a sound effect plays, the score increases, and the snake grows longer by adding a new segment to its body. The game loop continuously updates the snake's position, checks for collisions, and redraws the screen to reflect the current game state. The project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** as the code editor, with the **C++ extension** for syntax highlighting and debugging, and the code was compiled using **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**. I referred to the **SFML documentation** for guidance on using the library, watched **YouTube tutorials** to learn best practices, and used **Stack Overflow** to troubleshoot issues, particularly with handling user input and sound effects. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the snake could not reverse direction, which I resolved by adding checks to prevent the snake from moving in the opposite direction of its current movement. Another challenge was implementing collision detection with the snake's body, which required iterating through the snake's body segments and checking if the head collided with any segment. Additionally, I learned how to load and play sound effects using SFML's audio module, which involved using `sf::SoundBuffer` to load the sound file and `sf::Sound` to play it. The game provides a simple yet engaging experience, with smooth snake movement, responsive controls, and clear visual and audio feedback when the snake eats food. The game ends with a "Game Over" message displayed in the console, along with the player's final score. This project helped me gain a solid understanding of game development basics, including graphics rendering, user input handling, and collision detection, and I plan to expand the game with additional features such as increasing difficulty levels, graphical enhancements, a game over screen, and a high score system in the future. Overall, this Snake game project was a fun and educational experience that allowed me to apply my C++ programming skills to create an interactive and visually appealing game.
